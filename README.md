# Zara Website Redesign: A UX Case Study
## Project Overview
<p>Our team undertook the challenge of redesigning the Zara website as part of our Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) project. While Zara is a well-established fashion brand, its website presented several usability issues that hindered a smooth shopping experience. Our goal was to create an intuitive, user-friendly, and visually appealing interface that enhances navigation, searchability, and overall user experience.</p>

## The Design Challenge
<h5>Through our initial assessment, we identified key usability problems on Zara’s website:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Complex navigation made it difficult for users to find products quickly.<br></li>
  <li>Poor search functionality led to frustration and inefficiency.<br></li>
  <li>Lack of clear product details such as reviews and ratings reduced customer trust.<br></li>
  <li>Unintuitive filtering options made it harder to browse products effectively.<br></li>
  <li>Missing customer support information left users uncertain about returns and inquiries.<br></li>
</ul>

## User Research Findings
<h5>To validate our findings, we conducted three user interviews with novice, intermediate, and expert Zara shoppers. Key insights included</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Users struggled to locate specific products due to confusing navigation.<br></li>
  <li>Many found the lack of product reviews and ratings a major drawback.<br></li>
  <li>The checkout process was not seamless, making it harder to complete purchases.<br></li>
  <li>Users preferred a more structured and visually engaging layout to enhance browsing.<br></li>
</ul>

## Design Solutions Implemented
<h5>Based on our research, we redesigned Zara’s website with these improvements:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Enhanced Navigation: A more intuitive menu structure for easy browsing.<br></li>
  <li>Improved Search & Filtering: A robust filtering system to quickly find desired products.<br></li>
  <li>Better Product Pages: Added customer reviews, ratings, and clear size options.<br></li>
  <li>Streamlined Checkout: Simplified the checkout process for faster transactions.<br></li>
  <li>User-Centered UI: A modern and visually appealing design using Figma.<br></li>
</ul>
